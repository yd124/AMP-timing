To do
================

- Bryan can explore the correlation problem.
- Any of us can use the Monolix based on Fabian's initial set up to play around.
- Dan will take the parameter estimates and start simulating data, both control and VRC01 cohorts. 
- Dan will send back undersampled data with the aim of sending data that looks like real trial data with the infection time blinded.
- Fabian can start to try to do the estimation in the control and VRC01 cohorts?
- Bryan can write a script in R to exhaustively fit models while narrowing down parameters to find the optimal estimator of infection time? 
- Bryan will think about, or maybe even start formulating an approach to uncertainty quantification?
- Dan will look a bit into diversity stuff and see if that can be incorporated easily.


 DONE Mid Jan 2019

- Fabian can try to set up the Monolix to fit the data? I think we’ve decided on 3 models? 1. Basic with power law death rate 2. My monkey model 3. Monkey model + memory CD8 compartment ("smooth monkey" I’m calling it in my head)

DONE Mid Dec 2018

- Bryan can update GitHub so that the data are only up to 12 weeks? And maybe drop any individual with fewer than 5 data points?
